* [Detailed steps to create a spec project release](https://wiki.eclipse.org/How_to_Prepare_API_Projects_for_the_Jakarta_EE_8_Release)
* [Jakarta Specification Committee Specification Pages](https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications) - where the contents
for jakarta.ee website specificaiton pages are to be created via pull requests once a specification
project is ready for a release.

     *** Installation and configuration
     *** How to run the tests
     *** Where to file challenges
     *** TCK specific rules not covered in this process guide
     *** Instructions describing how to run the compatible implementation(s) that are being used to validate the TCK

  ** It is recommended that the TCK documentation include
     *** URLs for the issue trackers to file certification requests, bug reports, etc.
     *** A statement that the Certification of Compatibility process must be followed before a claim of compatibility can be made.
* [EFTL](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/tck.php) - The Eclipse Foundation Technology Compatibility Kit License that
must be included in the final TCK binaries a specification project produces. 

## Basic Info About Editing Site
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jakartaredhat/jakartaredhat..github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
